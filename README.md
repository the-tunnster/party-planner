# Party Planner
An application that makes it super easy to set up an eInvite, with a few quality of life improvements.

## Requirements
1. This repository, obviously.
2. A python runtime, unless I made a docker image somewhere down the line.
3. A server to deploy this to. Or you could just hit me up and we'll work something out.

## Set-Up
There should be a config.json file somewhere that simplifies the process.
Outside of that, just make sure you have python set up properly with a virtual environment and packages.
For everyone on a unix system at least, that's:
	`python3 -m venv ./.venv`
	`source ./.venv/bin/activate`
	`pip install -r requirements.txt`
